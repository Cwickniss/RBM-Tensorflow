Introduction to Restricted Boltzmann Machines using Tensorflow
====
Material
--------
The notebook tutorial reconstructs some digits doing unsupervised learning.

There is also an accompanying presentation I gave for my group at ENS.
The second part of the [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8w_D99ccMLYc2lEczlPZlhKNnM/view?usp=sharing)
has some derivations for classic RBMs and the Contrastive Divergence algorithm.

**Installation notes**

I suggest to create a special [environment](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html) for any Tensorflow related work using [Anaconda](Anaconda-Navigator:https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/navigator). All dependencies get automatically installed (i.e. Python/Jupyter/numpy)

```

conda create --name tensorflow-env
source activate tensorflow-env
jupyter notebook

```
